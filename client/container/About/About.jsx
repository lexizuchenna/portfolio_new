            A seasoned <span>full-stack developer</span> with over 6 years of
            hands-on experience in building robust web applications. My journey
            began with <span>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</span>, where I honed my
            skills over the course of 6 years, mastering the art of crafting
            intuitive and engaging user interfaces.
            <br /> <br />
            üíª For the past 5 years, I've delved deep into the world of modern
            web development, specializing in{" "}
            <span>React, Next.js, and Node.js (Express).</span> Whether it's
            crafting dynamic front-end experiences with React or architecting
            scalable back-end solutions with Node.js, I thrive on the challenges
            that come with building cutting-edge applications.
            <br /> <br />
            üîç In addition to my front-end and back-end expertise, I bring
            extensive experience in database management. Over the years, I've
            worked extensively with <span>MongoDB</span>, leveraging its
            flexibility and scalability to handle vast amounts of data
            efficiently. I've also dived into <span>MySQL</span>, where I've
            quickly adapted and applied my knowledge to build robust relational
            database solutions.
            <br /> <br />
            üöÄ What sets me apart is my passion for crafting elegant solutions
            that not only meet but exceed user expectations. I thrive in
            collaborative environments, where I can leverage my technical
            expertise to drive innovation and deliver exceptional results.
